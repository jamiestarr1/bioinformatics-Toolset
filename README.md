# bioinformatics-Toolset
The Perl scripting language was adopted for use in building these bioinformatics tools, because of the wide capability in performing Regex related tasks. First, the toolset includes data conversions between commonly used DNA sequencing formats, FastA and FastQ. Then, by building on that knowledge of the language, global and local sequence alignments were efficiently designed using dynamic programming techniques learned from core algorithm design and analysis coursework. Continuing to build on Perl Regex capability and efficient algorithm design, a Perl recreation of the popular genomics utility: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was created. This required reading and understanding the BLAST documentation, the science behind how it works, and then recreating its functionality within Perl for use from the command line.
